# UI ucGUI and QT
Try to use QT  and ucGUI to design a UI interface for medical device. HIS and LIS must be included. I will add some custome widget to build the UI. 

I wish to make the UI programmer can do UI interface as easy as eat a hamburger in Mcdonald's, just decide you need beef or fried chicken.

I will make some widget for ucGui first.
